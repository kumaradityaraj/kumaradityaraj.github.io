    <p style="width: 50%">
      House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast and have intermediate flavor. Here at Carta Coffee, our house blends are our Captain's Roast and Meridian Roast coffees.

       French roast coffee is one of many coffee roasts named for a regional roasting style. It was popular throughout much of Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Today, the term is used most often when describing almost any dark-roasted coffee.

Sometimes, French roast coffee is also referred to (colorfully) as Turkish roast, (incorrectly) as Espresso roast, or (simplistically) as Dark roast.

Trivia Time: Other regional roasts include New England roast coffee, Spanish roast coffee, Italian roast coffee, American roast coffee, and Vienna roast coffee.

     Colombia has one of the best climates for growing coffee beans. It has enough rain, has a lot of insects around (thus the beans contain more caffeine), and the soil is full of nutrients. All of these factors play a role in the fantastic taste of Colombian coffee.If you have a chance to try Colombian Supremo, then jump at the opportunity, as it is the highest quality of Colombian coffee. The ones who have been attempting it mostly say that it has a surprisingly sweet smell and a slightly caramel-like taste. Sounds greatBut Colombia also grows Arabica coffee, which is slightly different, but sometimes it is still referred to as Colombian coffee. These can have anywhere between 75 and 180 milligrams of caffeine in them. Companies also label these as Colombian coffee, so check once more if you don’t trust the label enough. Be sure to also check out “Coffee Insight: Arabica vs Colombian Coffee” for more differences between the two.
