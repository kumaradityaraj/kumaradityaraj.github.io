      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain Coffea species. When coffee berries turn from green
      to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed,
      and dried.[3] Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to
      varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground
      and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as
      coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a
      stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[4] It
      is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[5] and can be prepared and
      presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte,
      or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although
      chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream
      are often used to lessen the bitter taste. Clinical research indicates
      that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a
      stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term
      consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the
      long-term studies are of questionable credibility.[6] The earliest
      credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in
      modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in
      Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
      similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[2] The Yemenis procured
      the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
      intermediaries, and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had
      reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to
      Europe. The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and
      C. robusta. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries,
      primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the
      Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower
      of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[7] Coffee is a major
      export commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous
      countries.[8] It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by
      developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is one of the most traded
      agricultural commodities in the world.[9] The way developed countries
      trade coffee with developing nations has been criticised, as well as the
      impact on the environment with regards to the clearing of land for
      coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade and
      organic coffee are expanding.[10]
